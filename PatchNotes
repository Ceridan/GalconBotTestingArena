Version 2.0.3 Notes:
- Now fight total label updates on fly. So you can see win/lose/draw information immidiatly after each fight was finished.
- Added average turns number statistic in the fight total label.
- Added 'Command' column to the grid. You can see command which was executed to run this fight. So it coan be useuful for debugging this application. You can always save the value from the cell to clipboard (Ctrl+C) and then paste (Ctrl+V) it to command line and execute to test how it works.
- Fights tab scaling changed a bit (specially for Hazard :) ) and now you can resize two parts of the fights tab (if you move mouse to the border between progress bar and 'Galcon Bot Testing Arena result' panel you will see that cursor will changed and you can drag it to resize the panels).

Version 2.0.0 Notes:
1. New GUI. Now main form consists of three tabs:
	- path settings tab;
	- tools and bot extensions dictionary;
	- fight settings tab.
2. Bot extensions dictionary allows you to add your own bot execution files extensions, and modify coomand string to run your bots. You can modify tools files and starting commands for it too.
3. Multithreading supported. Now you can run your bot testing fights in several threads and stop it any time. Main form will be responsable now while test fights are running.

Version issues:
Multithreading doesn't give real calculation acceleration. Maybe this is due to intensive I/O operations.
